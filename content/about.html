            <p>If you're interested in supporting my writing work (and development work, if that's your bag!), I will be eternally grateful! I have a few mechanisms for support:</p>
            <h2>Publications</h2>
            <p>I have <a href="/publications">several publications available</a>! If you want to provide the greatest amount of support for your buck, consider buying direct from me! As a bonus, all books ordered direct are signed.</p>
            <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>One of the best ways to support me &mdash; for both me and for you &mdash; is through patronage! This lets me not only expect a regular monthly contribution from readers, but also gives you access to stuff that is exclusive to supporters.</p>
            <p>I know that it can be difficult to choose a method for subscriptions, and to that end, I've tried to set up a few possible options, all of which work on the same level of tiers:</p>
            <h3>Early Access &mdash; $1/mo</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Early access to finished works</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Coupons and sales</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Behind the scenes &mdash; $5/mo</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access to early drafts of works</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Free ebooks</strong></li>
                <li>Early access to finished works</li>
                <li>Coupons and sales</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>All access &mdash; $10/mo</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access to outlines and incomplete works</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Posts about the writing process and writing tech</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Free audiobooks</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Paperback books at cost</strong></li>
                <li>Access to early drafts of works</li>
                <li>Free ebooks</li>
                <li>Early access to finished works</li>
                <li>Coupons and sales</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you'd like to get in on early stuff that I write, get some free books, or even see how things work behind the scenes, one of these subscriptions might be good for you! You can subscribe through the following services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://subscribestar.com/makyo"><strong>SubscribeStar</strong></a></li>
                <li><a href="https://patreon.com/makyo"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></li>
                <li><a href="https://gum.co/makyo-patronage"><strong>Gumroad Subscription</strong></a> (This method is the least intrusive, as you will not receive any regular communications from me. The flip side is that you will have to keep an eye on my <a href="https://twitter.com/makyo_writes">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://maddypa.ws/@makyo">Mastodon</a> feeds for updates!)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you would simply like to shoot me a tip for something that you've enjoyed, you can feel free to do so over on <a href="https://ko-fi.com/drabmakyo">Ko-fi</a>, <a href="https://paypal.me/makyo">Paypal</a>, or <a href="https://cash.me/$makyo">Cash.me</a>.</p>
