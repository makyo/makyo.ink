<div class="quip verse">Her hair is tied with a ribbon
    Saying "<span class="gray">This is not for you.</span>"
She wears a pendant of stamped brass
    Saying "<span class="gray">Non sum qualis eram.</span>"
"<span class="gray">I have been a hero since birth,</span>"
    She tells herself,
        As though that will somehow
            Explain her scars.</div>
