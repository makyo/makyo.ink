<h3><span class="pink">Madison</span> <span class="gray">Scott-Clary</span></h3>

With topics ranging from gender to mental health, flower language to dogs, these five years worth of selected poems by Madison Scott-Clary represent some of her best works, now collected in to one book. ***Coming January 1, 2020!***

* Poems from *Missives*
    * Though the flow're may bloom ere long
    * Delay, then, the morn
    * Thy gift
    * You find me at a disadvantage
    * A rose, single, now blooming
* Unimportant verse about important people
* Collect haiku
* Mental Health
    * There is too much fire in me
    * Heligoland
    * Bruise vision
    * Beneath her coat was a whole identity
    * Asertu
    * Numeno
    * Rush
* Gender
    * Somehow, she's me
    * Post-op images
    * Fair and square
* Miscellany
    * The dogs assure me
    * A year starts not on January first
    * Growth
    * When I fall, I will remain whole
    * I know there's rest
    * Every time I fall
    * Meaning & Self

<div class="quip verse">Her hair is tied with a ribbon
    Saying "<span class="gray">This is not for you.</span>"
She wears a pendant of stamped brass
    Saying "<span class="gray">Non sum qualis eram.</span>"
"<span class="gray">I have been a hero since birth,</span>"
    She tells herself,
        As though that will somehow
            Explain her scars.</div>
