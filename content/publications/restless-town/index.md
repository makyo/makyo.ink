> I just need out of this town. This stupid fucking town. This brown and flat and sad town. This restless town. This home to ennui and melancholy. This scrub of buildings and people and emotions spilled in the middle of an apathetic landscape like hay from an overturned truck.

Restless Town is a collection of ten furry short stories from the fictional town of Sawtooth, Idaho, exploring the themes of identity, sexuality, and mental health. ***Coming November 15!***

* **Fisher** - A fisher walks and hunts for meaning.
* **Centerpiece** - A couple heads to a BDSM play party where the wife will be the Centerpiece for the whole party to enjoy. With fertility already on the mind, will another mink showing up throw a wrench in things?

* **Overclassification** - A chronically neat otter's life is thrown into disarray when she takes a homeless ringtail in from the cold.
