> *"All artists search. I search for stories, in this post-self age. What happens when you can no longer call yourself an individual, when you've split your sense of self among several instances? How do you react? Do you withdraw into yourself, become a hermit? Do you expand until you lose all sense of identity? Do you fragment? Do you go about it deliberately, or do you let nature and chance take their course?"*

*For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten.* What means time in a world where memory does not die? RJ, trapped in a solitary world, struggles to make eir way back to reality, paving the way for a world beyond the concept of self.

***Coming August 2020!***
