What if I tried to write a memoir?

Like.

It doesn't need to be totally true, and maybe some stuff gets pretty floaty, and maybe some stuff winds up as poetry, and maybe some of it is ergodic with scans of notes or bits of other projects scattered throughout, and maybe I just own the hypertextuality of the medium, but it's generally autobiographical.

That might be neat

> Who are you kidding?

Myself, I guess.

> Well, have at it, then.

**ally** is an autobiographical project. A lot of the information contained within is real, some of it isn't. Each page is structured as a conversation between myself and my ally, a mirror reflection of myself.

Based off the interactive project at [**ally.id**](ally.id), this book explores different facets of my life --- some true, some embellished, some wholly fictitious --- in a non-linear, ergodic fashion, using color, page-layout, and mixed-media to create a book more experience than memoir.

### Content warning

Several sections focus on suicide, self-harm, rape, sexual content, and poor mental health.
