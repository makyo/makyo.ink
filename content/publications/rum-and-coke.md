Much ink has been spent following the exploits of our furry characters, but sometimes, the real interest lies in the act of us as humans being furries. Follow the stories of three individuals as they navigate the world of relationships and furry conventions.

* What I Expected - as a genderqueer person, how does one go about having a romantic and sexual relationship with a cisgender person? Sascha doesn’t quite know, but it’s time to figure that out.
* How Many - Struggling with anxiety, Ian and his boyfriend are flying out to meet Ian’s new second partner, Rei for the very first time.
* Again - It’s not uncommon to see one’s ex has changed in interesting ways, but Michael is taken aback when his partner from years past shows up at the convention much different than before.

These three short pieces of erotica explore the unique aspects of romance and sex within the furry fandom, focusing on queer stories and highlighting the complexities of meeting up for the first time, or at least the first time in many years.
