title: Supporting my writing
---

There are a few ways that you can help support my writing.

Purchasing books
:   While all of my work is available to read for free in the browser, much of it is also available as paperbacks and ebooks as well. You may, of course, purchase these from many retailers online, but I also sell them direct. Ebooks are available on [Itch.io](https://makyo.itch.io) and paperbacks are available via my [Square store](https://makyo-ink.square.site).

Subscription services
:   I share in progress and completed work on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/makyo) and [Ream](https://reamstories.com/makyo). These subscriptions provide a way to see the work that goes into my writing, and is available at various levels of support.

Tips
:   Of course, if you simply wish to toss a tip my way, you can do so via [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/drabmakyo), [PayPal](https://paypal.me/makyo), or [Square Cash](https://cash.me/$makyo).
