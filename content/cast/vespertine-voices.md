*Vespertine Voices* is a planned podcast for sharing thoughtful and evocative furry writing, read for you by Madison Scott-Clary. I'm currently building up an initial backlog of recordings, and plan on releasing episodes every two weeks.

## What am I looking for?

The question of genre is a difficult one, and it is equally difficult to talk about without coming off as belittling other genres. The best thing to keep in mind when submitting is the narrator's voice and tone. My particular style is one well suited to low-action writing that tends toward more serious moods, with a particular focus on contemplative fiction. As a trans woman, my voice tends to land somewhere between baritone and contralto. For an example, please check out my existing podcast [Makyo Writes](https://anchor.fm/makyo-writes).

Please don't let that restrict you based on genre --- science fiction can exist alongside contemporary slice-of-life fiction. Adult fiction is also welcome. If you have a non-fiction piece in mind, feel free to pitch that as well.

If comparative works help, think *Annihilation* by Jeff VanderMeer, *Wolf in White Van* by John Darnielle, *Pattern Recognition* by William Gibson, *99% Invisible*, or *This American Life*. Basically, if it would fit in well with Hazlitt, Harper's, or on public radio, that's probably a good start!

Word-counts of 2,000--15,000 are welcome. If your story is longer than that, please feel free to email all the same, but I will set a hard limit of 20,000 words.

## How to submit

Please email me with the following information:

* Your name and pronouns as you would like to be addressed.
* A description of yourself for the introduction of the episode, including a link if you have one.
* The title of the story.
* The word count.
* Whether or not the story should be marked as 18+.
* A brief, one-sentence description of the story to go in the episode listing.
* A small synopsis of the story for my sake.
* Whether or not you would be interested in an interview for a follow-up episode.
* The story itself.

Please email stories to *makyo+vespertine[at]drab-makyo.com* with your name and the story's title in the subject line.
