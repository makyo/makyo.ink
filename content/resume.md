*Sultan, WA — <madison@makyo.io> — 303-818-5943*

-----

I am an author, technical writer, and software developer living up in the Cascades Northeast of Seattle. I've been keenly focused on open-source and freely available software since I first began programming two decades ago, and in free access to information for nearly as long, focused on liberal licences such as MIT and CreativeCommons. With twenty years programming experience and ten years writing and community education and organization experience, I hope to bring all that I can to my new role.
